# Stock-Market-Forecasting
This project provides a Python-based solution for stock market forecasting. It utilizes historical stock price data to train various machine learning models and predict future stock prices.

## Data
The project requires historical stock price data to train the forecasting models. The data should be in CSV format, with each row representing a specific date and containing the stock's closing price. The CSV file should have a header row and include columns for date and closing price.

## Models
This project provides an implementation of various machine learning models for stock market forecasting. The notebook demonstrates the following models:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network

## Evaluation
The notebook includes an evaluation section that assesses the performance of the trained models. It provides various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help you compare the models and understand their forecasting accuracy.

## Here are some working snapshots of the application.
